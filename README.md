# kcni_summer_school_website

The website is written in Hugo and deployed with CI on Netlify. 

The site is now live at [kcnischool.org](www.kcnischool.org)

The site will re-build upon each new commit to this repo. 

To see changes, wait 20 secs or so, and then refresh the page. 

The github text editor should be sufficient for most changes. You can of course also clone, make changes locally, and push. 


# Structure: 

- Landing page and title are specified in config.toml

- Main pages are specified in 'content' folder

- Text is mostly written in markdown
